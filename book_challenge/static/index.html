        <h2>Book Challenge</h2>
        <p>Hello super reader! Welcome to Uncle Scott's Super Readers Reading Challenge where you get points for reading everyday! </p>
        <h4>How can I earn points?</h4>
        <p>You earn points by reading or being read to. Every page you read is 1 point. Every book you read is 10 points. If you read a page or
        more a day for a whole week that's 100 points. If you read a page or more a day for a whole month you get 500 points. And finally if you
        truly are a super reader and read a page or more every day for two months straight all points are doubled. Meaning every page you read is 
        worth 2 points; every book is worth 20 points; a week of reading is 200 points; a month of reading is 1000 points. 
        </p>
        <h4>What can I do with these points?</h4>
        <p>You spend these points on various prizes:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>100 points -> Slurpee from 7-11</li>
